Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Streamlit

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview:
Developed a data-driven web application that predicts the win probability of IPL teams in real-time using machine learning models. The project leverages historical IPL match data to evaluate the current game scenario and provide probability insights.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
Predicts win probabilities based on match progress (runs, wickets, overs, current run rate, required run rate, etc.)

Clean and intuitive Streamlit UI for user interaction

Real-time predictions with dynamic probability charts

Data preprocessing and feature engineering using Pandas & NumPy

Model trained using Logistic Regression / Random Forest for classification

Visualizations using Matplotlib to show historical win trends

ðŸ“ˆ Use Case Example:
Input current match details:

Target: 180 runs

Current Score: 120/4 in 15 overs

Output:

Win Probability: Team A â€“ 68%, Team B â€“ 32%

ðŸ’¡ Objective:
To help fans and analysts make data-backed predictions during live matches and improve understanding of key factors influencing match outcomes.
